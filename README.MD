# 🌐 **TEKA Blockchain**

**TEKA** is a **Layer 1 blockchain** built from scratch in **Rust**. It leverages a **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** consensus mechanism to provide high transaction throughput, security, and energy efficiency. TEKA is designed to empower developers and communities to build decentralized applications, issue native tokens, and contribute to a scalable blockchain ecosystem.

## 🌟 **Overview**

TEKA is built to address the limitations of existing Layer 1 blockchain protocols by focusing on:
- **High Transaction Throughput (TPS)**  
- **Energy-Efficient Consensus (PoS)**  
- **Native Token Deployment for Validators**  
- **User-Created Tokens Support**  
- **Secure Node Broadcasting & Communication**  

TEKA is not just a blockchain; it's a platform for building **decentralized finance (DeFi)** solutions, **smart contracts**, and **custom token ecosystems**.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

1. **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Consensus:**  
   Validators secure the network by staking native tokens, ensuring decentralized validation.

2. **Native Token (TEKA):**  
   Used for staking, governance, and transaction fees.

3. **User-Created Tokens:**  
   Allows users to issue their own tokens, similar to ERC-20.

4. **High Scalability:**  
   Optimized for low latency and high throughput.

5. **Secure Communication Layer:**  
   Peer-to-peer (P2P) network for fast and reliable broadcasting.

6. **API Integration via RPC:**  
   Expose endpoints for wallets, explorers, and dApps.

## 🛠️ **Architecture**

### **Core Components:**
- **Consensus Module:** Implements Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validator selection and rewards distribution.
- **Blockchain Module:** Manages block creation, validation, and transaction pools.
- **Token Module:** Native TEKA token management for staking and governance.
- **User Token Module:** Allows users to create custom tokens.
- **Network Module:** Peer-to-peer (P2P) node communication.
- **RPC Module:** API endpoints for external interaction.
- **Storage Module:** Persistent blockchain state storage (RocksDB).

### **Data Structures:**
- **Block:** Contains index, transactions, timestamp, and validator signature.
- **Transaction:** Represents token transfers and staking actions.
